            Investment is the act of putting your money into something with the hope that it will grow in value or earn more money over time.

            <br/><br/>You can invest in many things—like buying shares in a company, owning land, or even starting a small business.

            <br/><br/>📈 The goal of investment is to make your money work for you instead of just sitting in a bank account.

            <br/><br/>Let’s break it down:

            <ul className="list-disc ml-5">
                <li>If you buy a stock, you’re investing in a company.</li>
                <li>If you buy land, you’re investing in real estate.</li>
                <li>If you lend money to the government or a company, you’re buying a bond.</li>
            </ul>

            These are all types of investments.

            <br/><br/><br/><br/>🔍Why Do People Invest?
            <br/><br/>People invest because:


            <br/><br/>They want to reach financial goals like buying a house, paying for school, or retiring comfortably

            <ul className="list-disc ml-5">
                <li>They want to grow their money over time</li>
                <li>They want to earn returns (profit) from interest, dividends, or value increase</li>
                <li>They want to reach financial goals like buying a house, paying for school, or retiring comfortably</li>
            </ul>

            <br/><br/><br/>📌 Example
            <br/><br/>Let’s say you invest ₦10,000 in a business. After a year, the business grows, and your share is now worth ₦12,000.

            <br/><br/>You just earned a ₦2,000 return on your investment! 🎉

            <br/><br/><br/><br/>✅ In Short:
            Investment = putting money into something that can grow or pay you back more in the future.
